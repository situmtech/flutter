## How to run the app

### Step 1: Install the dependencies

The first step is to download this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/situmtech/flutter.git
```

And then install the plugin dependencies alongside the `example` app as follows:

```bash
cd flutter/example
flutter pub get
```

#### iOS only

Run `pod install` or `pod update` from the `example/ios` folder to bring the dependencies to your project.

Also check out the project [code signing](https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/) before you run the example.

### Step 2: Set up your Situm credentials

This example provides you with a template on `lib/config.dart.example`:

> **Warning**
> Rename `config.dart.example` to `config.dart`.

Now populate it with [your credentials](https://situm.com/docs/built-in-wayfinding-ui/#prepare-viewer):

```dart
const situmApiKey = "YOUR-SITUM-API-KEY";
const buildingIdentifier = "YOUR-SITUM-BUILDING-IDENTIFIER";
```

### Step 3: Run the app <a name="runapplication"></a>

From the `example` folder, execute the following command which works on both Android and iOS devices:

```bash
flutter run
```

You can also run the app from your IDE:

- On Android: open `example/android/` with Android Studio.
- On iOS: open `example/ios/Runner.xcworkspace` with XCode.

## Documentation

More information on how to use the official Flutter plugin and the set of APIs, the functions, parameters and results each function accepts and provides can be found in our [SDK API Reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/situm_flutter/latest/situm_flutter_sdk/situm_flutter_sdk-library.html) and [Wayfinding API Reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/situm_flutter/latest/situm_flutter/situm_flutter-library.html).

### Examples

1. [**Basic SDK and Wayfinding functionality**](./lib/main.dart): showcases how to initialize the Situm SDK (refer to the [flutter sdk quickstart guide](https://situm.com/docs/a-basic-flutter-app/) for more information) and how to use some basic features like positioning and obtaining the information of a given building. It also shows how to use the Situm Wayfinding module (refer to the [flutter wayfinding quickstart guide](https://situm.com/docs/flutter-quickstart-guide/) for more information).
